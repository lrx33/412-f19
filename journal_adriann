---- May 25: Refactor net80211
---- May 26: Keep datasheets permanently somewhere

May 25, 2020
net80211 refactor required for transferring rate stuff as this is needed by other drivers as well.
The thing is a mess for now as drivers have to redo a lot of work and it doesnt make sense in the drivers.
23:14 < adrian> yeah
23:14 < adrian> just take notes
23:14 < adrian> I'm taking a "fix the fucking rate table fetching and stuff" as a net80211 refactor
23:15 < adrian> cause a few drivers have to replicate this nonsense now and it's really stupid

Put the datasheets somewhere more permanent so it doesnt get lost.
21:56 < lrx33> PS - The comments in if_runreg.h
21:56 < adrian> i saw
21:56 < lrx33> about the datasheet, I think those could go in too
21:56 < adrian> i'll hopefully have some here soon
21:56 < adrian> well
21:56 < adrian> i'd like to try and get the datasheet put somewhere more permanent
21:56 < adrian> so it won't , you know, disappear. :P
21:57 < lrx33> adrian: sure, we could figure out what to do about that later
21:57 < lrx33> I'm holding it in my repo, and the journal / notes im maintaining
21:57 < adrian> cool

16:43 < adrian> oh and don't add the MCS32 bits in
16:43 < adrian> for now
16:44 < adrian> just leave a comment about maybe fiddling with them later, but we shouldn't try to do the dup rate stuff right now
